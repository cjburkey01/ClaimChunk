# This file contains a list of the valid permissions that players can
# enable/disable in their chunks to determine what other are allowed to do in
# their claimed chunk(s).
#
# When a user has a flag enabled, it overrides all more specific flag targets
# even when they're disabled. So for example, if a user has some `interact`
# flag enabled for one of their chunks, it does not matter if they have it
# disabled for a specific player (either globally or in that chunk).
# This may end up being a big foot-gun! This should be changed to some
# "enabled/disabled/unset" system
#
# When specifying included/excluded blocks and entities, you can use either the
# resource name (like `minecraft:dirt`, for example), the Spigot/Bukkit
# name (like `DIRT`), or predefined "classes" (like `@CONTAINER_ENTITIES`)
#
# Class references (preceded by `@`) reference the classes described in:
# /plugins/ClaimChunk/classes.yml
#
# By default, blocks/entities listed in flags will have protection from other
# players *enabled* when the flag is disabled!
# The `protectWhen` value can be used within each protection type list.
# If set to `ENABLED`, the protections will only be applied once the owner has
# enabled the flag for their claim(s).
# For an example, see the `disablePvp` flag below, which protects player
# entities once the flag has been enabled, rather than by default.
