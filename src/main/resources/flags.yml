# This file contains a list of the valid permissions that players can
# enable/disable in their chunks to determine what other are allowed to do in
# their claimed chunk(s).
#
# When specifying included/excluded blocks and entities, you can use either the
# resource name (like `minecraft:dirt`, for example), the Spigot/Bukkit
# name (like `DIRT`), or predefined "classes" (like `@CONTAINER_ENTITIES`)
#
# Class references (preceded by `@`) reference the DEFAULT classes that appear
# at the top of newly generated world profile files (to make my life easier)
# (TODO: Move the definition of those classes to a separate file to make
#        *everyone's* life easier)
