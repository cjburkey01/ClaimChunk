# ClaimChunk 0.0.25-FIX1

Fixes:
* Re-add the `claimchunk_am_trusted` placeholder
  * The placeholder works the same way, returning that the player is trusted if 
    said player has *any* permissions granted by the owner for the chunk they're
    standing in (the chunk must be owned; the placeholder shows not trusted in 
    unclaimed chunks to match pre-0.0.24 behavior).
