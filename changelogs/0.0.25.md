# ClaimChunk 0.0.25

This update fixes, once and for all, the data loss issues we've been seeing
since I first created this plugin!

Migration:
* Should not require any extra work, keep your config the same for at least the first run.
* 1.0.0 will remove the database section of the config, but leave it be for your first launch to make sure old data loads.
* Prior data from JSON and from MySQL will be converted automatically to the SQLite data file, and JSON backups will be made for you in the `/plugins/ClaimChunk/data` directory.
